So i want to start out saying that i really enjoyed the assignment. I have never worked with API Gateway like this before. I also only had 1 day experience with CDK and Typescript before this so i chose to spend most of my time on the CRUD application due to the fact that i saw great learning opportunities there. I was able to do the problem solving puzzles but did not have time left for most of the AWS Knowledge checks.

Things that i would improve on my current CRUD solution but could not due to lack of time:

- Add Lambda Authorizer for security.
- Add schema validation for incoming bodies.
- Add a delete with a path parameter (I created the DELETE before i learned how the GET worked with path parameters.)
- Add integer or list attributes/values in database. For example with countries(list) or pages(integer) attributes.
- Make query be able to query certain values instead of only the whole record.
- Add Testing.

I would love to discuss this case further and learn what best practices are for solutions like this.
